<ul>
<li><p>A content delivery network or content distribution network is <strong>a system of computers containing copies of data placed at various nodes of a network</strong>. When properly designed and implemented, a CDN can improve access to the data it caches by increasing access bandwidth and redundancy and reducing access latency, Data content types often caches in CDNs including web objects, downloadable objects....</p></li>
<li><p>The capacity sum of strategically placed servers can be higher than the network backbone capacity. This can result in an impressive increase in the number of concurrent users. For instance, <strong>when there is a 10 Gbit/s network backbone and 200 Gbit/s central server capacity, only 10 Gbit/s can be delivered</strong>. But <strong>when 10 servers are moved to 10 edge locations, total capacity can be 10 10 Gbit/s</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategically placed edge servers decrease the load on interconnects, public peers, private peers and backbones, freeing up capacity and lowering delivery costs. It uses the same principle as above. Instead of loading all traffic on a backbone or peer link, a CDN can offload these by redirecting traffic to edge servers.</p></li>
<li><p>CDN generally deliver content over TCP and UDP connections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TCP throughput over a network is affected by both latency and packet loss</strong>. In order to reduce both of these parameters, <strong>CDNs traditionally place servers as close to the edge networks that users are on as possible</strong>. Theoretically the closer the content the faster the delivery, <strong>although network distance may not be the factor that leads to best performance</strong>. End users will likely experience less jitter, fewer network peaks and surges, and improved stream quality- especially in remote areas. The increased reliability allows a CDN operator to deliver HD quality content with high Quality of Service, low costs and low network load. <strong>Some providers also utilize TCP acceleration technology to further boost CDN’s performance and end-user experiences</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations, often over multiple backbones. These nodes cooperate with each other to satisfy requests for content by end users, transparently moving content to optimize the delivery process. Optimization can take the form of reducing bandwidth costs, improving end-user performance (reducing page load times and improving user experience), or increasing global availability of content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Requests for content are typically algorithmically directed to nodes that are optimal in some way</strong>. When optimizing for performance, locations that are best for serving content to the user may be chosen. This may be measured by <strong>choosing locations that are the fewest hops, the fewest number of network seconds away from the requesting client, or the highest availability in terms of server performance</strong> (both current and historical), so as to optimize delivery across local networks. When optimizing for cost, locations that are least expensive may be chosen instead.</p></li>
<li><p>In an optimal scenario, these two goals tend to align, as servers that are close to the end user at the edge of the network may have an advantage in performance or cost. The edge network is grown outward from the origin/s by further acquiring (via purchase, peering, or exchange) co- location facilities, bandwidth and servers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet was designed according to the end-to-end principle. This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network end-points: the hosts and clients. As a result the core network is specialized, simplified, and optimized to only forward data packets.</p></li>
<li><p>Content Delivery Networks augment the end-to-end transport network by distributing on it a variety of intelligent applications employing techniques designed to optimize content delivery. The resulting tightly integrated overlay uses web caching, server-load balancing, request routing, and content services.</p></li>
<li><p>Web caches store popular content on servers that have the greatest demand for the content requested. These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements, reduce server load, and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache.</p></li>
<li><p>Server-load balancing uses one or more techniques including service based (global load balancing) or hardware based, known as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to share traffic among a number of servers or web caches. Here the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address. Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch. This has the advantage of balancing load, increasing total capacity, improving scalability, and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks.</p></li>
<li><p>A content cluster or service node can be formed using a layer 4-7 switch balance load across a number of servers or a number of web caches within the network.</p></li>
<li><p>Request routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request. This may involve directing a client request to the service node that is closest to the client, or to the one with the most capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>CDNs use a variety of methods of content delivery including, but not limited to, manual asset coping, active web caches, and global hardware load balancers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Although peer-to-peer is not traditional CDN technology, it is increasingly used to deliver content to end users</strong>. P2P claims low cost and efficient distribution. Even though P2P actually generates more traffic than traditional client-server CDNs for the edge provider (because a<br/>
peer also uploads data instead of just downloading it) it’s welcome by parties running content delivery/distribution services. The real strength of P2P shows when one has to distribute data in high demand, like the latest episode of a television show or some sort of software patch/update in short period of time. One of the advantages of this is that the more people who download the same data, the more efficient P2P is for the provider, slashing the cost of the transit fees that a CDN provider has to pay to their upstream IP transit providers.</p></li>
