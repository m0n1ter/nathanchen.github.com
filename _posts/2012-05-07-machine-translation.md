##Machine Translation

1. On a basic level, MT performs a simple substitution of words in one natural language for words in another, but that alone usually cannot produce a good translation of a text, because recognition of whole phrases and their closet counterparts in the target language is needed. Solving this problem with corpus and statistical techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations.

2. Current machine translation software often allows for customisation by domain or profession, improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions. This technique is particularly effective is domains where formal or formulaic language is used. It follows that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than conversation or less standardised textã€‚

3. Improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention.
